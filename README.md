# fuel-prices
# Finding nearest fuel stations

Displays the nearest gas stations in the suburb that is being searched which sells the fuel type that has been requested

## Description

I subconsciously compare fuel prices of different gas station brands as well as how they change over time to find an opportunity to fill up at a good price. That being said, I wanted to create this app to quickly show me details of gas stations in a quick and easy to understand manner. Important factors considered was the station name, the distance and the gas price. With the input parameters of suburb name, postcode and fuel type, a list of results is quickly generated. 

### Executing program

To run the program, run 'python3 manage.py runserver' in fuel_prices directory.
